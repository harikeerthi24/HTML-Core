    <p>In computer programming, a comment is a piece of text within a programs code that is 
        not executed by the computer but is used to explain the code and make it easier to understand. 
        Comments can be used to provide information about the author of the code, the date it was written, and any changes that have been made to it. They can also be used to disable parts of the code temporarily for debugging purposes1. 
        In general, comments are remarks, suggestions or feedback about a product or service.</p>
